### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.58.0 supports OpenJDK 26.

OpenJDK 26 with Eclipse OpenJ9 is *not* a long term support (LTS) release.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### ![Start of content that applies to Java 26 and later](cr/java26plus.png) New JDK 26 features

The following features are supported by OpenJ9:

- [JEP 500](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/500): Prepare to Make Final Mean Final
- [JEP 529](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/529): Vector API (Eleventh Incubator)

The following features are implemented in OpenJDK and available in any build of OpenJDK 26 with OpenJ9:

- [JEP 504](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/504): Remove the Applet API
- [JEP 517](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/517): HTTP/3 for the HTTP Client API

You can find the full list of features for JDK 26 at the [OpenJDK project](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/26/).
Any remaining features that are listed either do not apply to OpenJ9 or are not implemented and hence not applicable to OpenJ9 in this release. ![End of content that applies to Java 26 and later](cr/java_close.png)
