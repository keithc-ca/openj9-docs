# What's new in version 0.30.0

The following new features and notable changes since version 0.29.0 are included in this release:

- [New binaries and changes to supported environments](#binaries-and-supported-environments)
- [Changes to the shared classes cache generation number](#changes-to-the-shared-classes-cache-generation-number)
- [Ignored options now captured in java dumps](#ignored-options-captured-in-java-dumps)
- [New `-XX:[+|-]EnsureHashed` option added](#new-xx-ensurehashed-option-added)
- [Redesigned heap resizing for balanced GC policy](#redesigned-heap-resizing-for-balanced-gc-policy)

## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

OpenJ9 release 0.30.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11 and 17.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### Changes to the shared classes cache generation number

The format of classes that are stored in the shared classes cache is changed, which causes the JVM to create a new shared classes cache rather than re-creating or reusing an existing cache. To save space, you can remove all existing shared caches unless they are in use by an earlier release. For more information about the `-Xshareclasses` option, including the `destroy` options that you can use to remove caches, see [`-Xshareclasses`](xshareclasses.md).

### Ignored options captured in java dumps

For improved compatibility with other Java implementations, OpenJ9 ignores many command-line options. If any were ignored, they are now listed in java dump files. For example, this command
<pre>
java -Xdump:java:events=vmstop -XX:+UseCompressedOop -XX:CompressedClassSpaceSize=528482304 -version
</pre>
would yield the following in the <tt>ENVINFO</tt> section after the complete list of all command-line arguments
<pre>
1CIIGNOREDARGS Ignored Args:
2CIIGNOREDARG            -XX:+UseCompressedOop
2CIIGNOREDARG            -XX:CompressedClassSpaceSize=528482304
</pre>

### New `-XX:[+|-]EnsureHashed` option added

This option specifies/unspecifies classes of objects that will be hashed and extended with a hash slot upon object creation or first move. This option may improve performance for applications that frequently hash objects of a certain type. See [-XX:[+|-]EnsureHashed](xxensurehashed.md) for more details.

### Redesigned heap resizing for balanced GC policy

Heap resizing heuristics have been redesigned for balanced GC. This includes both total heap resizing including Eden and non-Eden components indenpendantly, and also balancing between these two components when heap is fully expanded. The heuristics now combine both CPU overhead (for both Partial GCs and Global Mark Phase) and heap occupancy criteria. The balancing between Eden and non-Eden for fully expanded heaps is far more dynamic (instead of being mostly fixed to ratio 1:4).

As a consequence there should typically be less need for heap sizing tuning options, most notably for Eden sizing options [-Xmn/mns/mnx](xmn.md).

Also, a new soft limit pause target is added for Partial GCs, that defaults to 200ms. This criteria is combined with PGC CPU overhead critera for a balanced compromise between minimizing footprint, maximizing throughput and meeting the paused time target.

More details about the new heurstics can be found at:

[https://blog.openj9.org/2021/09/24/balanced-gc-performance-improvements-eden-heap-sizing-improvements/](https://blog.openj9.org/2021/09/24/balanced-gc-performance-improvements-eden-heap-sizing-improvements/)

The heuristcs now obey existing options

[-Xmint/-Xmaxt](xmint.md) and <br />
[-Xgc:dnssExpectedTimeRatioMaximum/Minimum](xgc.md#dnssexpectedtimeratiomaximum)

previously used for optthruput/optavgpause/gencon GC policies and also

[-Xgc:targetPausetime](xgc.md#targetpausetime)

previosly used only for Metronome GC policy.
